# Astraea

The greek goddess Astraea wept when she looked up at the night sky and saw that there were not enough stars. As her tears fell to Earth, they turned into the star-shaped flowers that bear her name. Aster is the september flower, after the Greek word for Star, symbolizing love, patience, wisdom, faith, and justice. Seeded with love on Starknet for Starktember 2025.
